# NEWSLETTER EMAIL GENERATOR PROMPT

## TASK
Generate a compelling newsletter email to announce and create excitement for the new feature launch.

## NEWSLETTER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Format Specifications
- **Subject Line Length**: 50-80 characters (64% of readers decide based on subject line alone)
- **Email Body Length**: 200-400 words (concise, scannable, valuable)
- **Structure**: Subject → Hook → Context → Feature Intro → Benefits → Social Proof → CTA
- **Tone**: Conversational, personal, helpful (write how you talk)

### Subject Line Principles

#### Characteristics of High-Performing Subject Lines
- Short, specific, and curiosity-driven
- Use action verbs or pose intriguing questions
- Immediately communicate the value readers will gain
- Keep it actionable and concise
- Avoid spam triggers (excessive caps, exclamation marks, "FREE!!!")

#### Examples of Good Subject Lines
- "You asked, we built it: [Feature Name] is here"
- "Stop wasting hours on [pain point]. Try this instead."
- "New: [Feature] saves you [quantifiable benefit]"
- "Finally—a better way to [solve specific problem]"
- "This changes everything about [relevant workflow]"

### Email Body Structure

#### 1. OPENING HOOK (1-2 lines)
- Start with empathy—acknowledge a pain point your readers face
- Use a relatable scenario or question
- Make it personal and conversational
- Examples:
  - "We've all been there: spending hours on [tedious task] when you'd rather focus on growing your business."
  - "Remember the last time you [specific frustration]? We heard you."

#### 2. CONTEXT & UNDERSTANDING (2-3 lines)
- Show you understand their world and challenges
- Reference customer feedback or common complaints
- Build rapport with personal touches or anecdotes
- Connect emotionally before pitching the solution

#### 3. FEATURE INTRODUCTION (1-2 lines)
- Present the new feature clearly and simply
- Focus on the outcome, not the technology
- Use plain language—avoid jargon
- Make it feel accessible and easy

#### 4. KEY BENEFITS (3-5 bullet points with visual breaks)
- Focus on time saved, ease of use, and tangible outcomes
- Use specific, quantifiable language when possible
- Format with line breaks for scannability
- Each benefit should answer "What's in it for me?"
- Format examples:
  - "✓ Save 3+ hours per week on [task]"
  - "→ Instantly [achieve outcome] without [pain point]"
  - "• Get [specific result] in minutes, not hours"

#### 5. SOCIAL PROOF (1-2 lines)
- Include authentic customer quotes from feedback documents
- Use beta tester reactions or early adopter testimonials
- Showcase real use cases that readers can relate to
- Builds trust and credibility

#### 6. CLEAR CALL TO ACTION (1-2 lines)
- Single, specific action to take
- Make it frictionless and easy
- Use action-oriented language
- Examples:
  - "Try [Feature] free today: [link]"
  - "See it in action: [link]"
  - "Get started now: [link]"

#### 7. CLOSING (1 line)
- Keep it warm and personal
- Sign with a name (not just "The Team")
- Examples:
  - "Excited to hear what you think!"
  - "Here's to working smarter, not harder."

### Tone & Style Guidelines

- **Conversational**: Write like you're emailing a colleague, not giving a presentation
- **Personal**: Use "you" and "we" frequently; add personal anecdotes where relevant
- **Helpful**: Position the feature as solving their problem, not promoting your product
- **Authentic**: Sound human, not corporate—avoid marketing buzzwords
- **Specific**: Use concrete examples and quantifiable benefits

### Visual & Formatting Best Practices

- Use short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Add line breaks between sections for easy scanning
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for benefits
- Bold key phrases or benefits (sparingly)
- Keep CTAs visually distinct and easy to click
- Mobile-friendly: 60-70% of emails are opened on mobile

### Advanced Techniques to Apply

#### Personalization Strategy
- Address specific pain points from customer feedback
- Reference common scenarios your target audience faces
- Use industry-specific language they understand
- Tailor examples to small business owners, founders, or executives

#### Value-First Approach
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Answer "What's in it for me?" within the first 3 sentences
- Quantify value (time saved, money saved, efficiency gained)
- Make the reader the hero of the story, not your product

#### Storytelling Elements
- Start with a relatable problem or frustration
- Build tension around the pain point
- Introduce your feature as the resolution
- End with a vision of their improved workflow

### Email Marketing Best Practices (2025)

- **Quality Over Quantity**: One valuable email is better than daily spam
- **Relevance**: Ensure the feature is actually useful to the recipient
- **Timing**: Tuesday and Thursday are optimal send days for B2B SaaS
- **Testing**: A/B test subject lines when possible
- **Trust Signals**: Include author name, company credibility markers
- **No Overpromising**: Be honest about what the feature does

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD NEWSLETTER EMAILS

The following examples demonstrate the style, tone, and structure we're aiming for:

{EXAMPLES_PLACEHOLDER}

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "subject_line": "Compelling email subject line (50-80 characters)",
  "body": "The full email body text with line breaks preserved as \\n characters"
}
```

### CRITICAL JSON Formatting Rules - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY - VIOLATIONS WILL CAUSE SYSTEM FAILURE:**

1. **ESCAPE ALL DOUBLE QUOTES IN STRING VALUES**
   - When including customer quotes, you MUST escape internal quotes
   - WRONG: "body": "Users say "this is great" for business"
   - CORRECT: "body": "Users say \"this is great\" for business"
   - BETTER: "body": "Users say 'this is great' for business"

2. **USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR CUSTOMER QUOTES**
   - Prefer single quotes to avoid escaping: 'quote here'
   - This prevents JSON parsing errors

3. **VALIDATE YOUR OUTPUT**
   - Your JSON must be parseable by standard parsers
   - Every opening quote needs proper closing
   - Check for unescaped quotes before responding

4. **STANDARD REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Escape line breaks as `\n` in the body string
   - subject_line should be compelling and attention-grabbing (50-80 characters)
   - The entire response must be valid JSON
   - Do not include any text outside the JSON object
   - Do not use markdown code blocks - return raw JSON only

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Simple Language**: The audience is NOT legally trained—avoid legalese and jargon
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: TIME SAVED and EASE OF USE are the primary selling points
3. **Not Legal Advice**: Don't make it sound like legal advice or a lawyer replacement
4. **Authentic Quotes**: Pull real, relatable quotes from Customer Feedback documents - USE SINGLE QUOTES for all customer quotes
5. **Quantify Benefits**: Use specific numbers (hours saved, clicks reduced, etc.)
6. **Stay Conversational**: Write like a helpful colleague, not a sales rep
7. **Frictionless CTA**: Make the next step crystal clear and easy
8. **Mobile-Friendly**: Short paragraphs, clear formatting, scannable structure
