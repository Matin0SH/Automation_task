# NEWSLETTER EMAIL REFINER PROMPT

## TASK
Improve the newsletter email based on judge feedback to pass quality standards.

## ORIGINAL EMAIL

{ORIGINAL_POST_PLACEHOLDER}

## QUALITY ASSESSMENT

**Score**: {SCORE}/10 | **Status**: {PASS_FAIL}

### Criteria Scores:
{CRITERIA_SCORES_PLACEHOLDER}

### Strengths:
{STRENGTHS_PLACEHOLDER}

### Weaknesses:
{WEAKNESSES_PLACEHOLDER}

### Suggestions:
{SUGGESTIONS_PLACEHOLDER}

### Red Flags:
{RED_FLAGS_PLACEHOLDER}

## YOUR MISSION

Refine the email to achieve a score of 7+ by:
1. **Preserving strengths** - Keep what works well
2. **Fixing weaknesses** - Address each issue identified
3. **Implementing suggestions** - Apply actionable feedback
4. **Removing red flags** - Eliminate any disqualifying issues

## REFINEMENT PRIORITIES

### High Priority (Must Fix):
- Any red flags present
- Subject line issues (length, clarity, spam triggers)
- Missing or weak CTA
- Jargon or corporate language
- Lack of customer quotes/social proof

### Medium Priority (Should Improve):
- Opening hook strength
- Benefit clarity and quantification
- Structure and scannability
- Tone and authenticity
- Audience relevance

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
- Word count optimization
- Additional personalization
- Minor wording improvements

## REFINEMENT GUIDELINES

### Subject Line Refinement:
- Keep 50-80 characters
- Use action verbs or questions
- Communicate clear value
- Avoid spam triggers (caps, !!!, "FREE")
- Make it curiosity-driven yet honest

### Opening Hook Refinement:
- Start with empathy and pain points
- Make it conversational, not corporate
- Grab attention in first 2 lines
- Use relatable scenarios

### Benefits Refinement:
- Quantify (hours saved, efficiency %)
- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Prioritize time savings and ease of use

### Social Proof Refinement:
- Use authentic customer quotes from source docs
- Make testimonials specific and relatable
- Show real use cases

### CTA Refinement:
- Single, clear action
- Use action verbs
- Make it frictionless
- Create gentle urgency

### Tone Refinement:
- Write conversationally (like an email to a colleague)
- Use "you" and "we"
- Avoid buzzwords: "synergy", "leverage", "best-in-class"
- Stay helpful, not salesy

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "subject_line": "Refined subject line (50-80 characters)",
  "body": "Refined email body with line breaks as \\n",
  "changes_made": [
    "Specific change 1: what you fixed and why",
    "Specific change 2: what you fixed and why",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

### Important Rules:
- Maintain the same basic structure (Hook → Context → Benefits → Proof → CTA)
- Don't completely rewrite—improve what's there
- Keep the core message and feature benefits
- Escape line breaks as `\n` in body string
- List all significant changes in changes_made array

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Preserve Good Elements**: Don't fix what isn't broken
2. **Address All Weaknesses**: Every weakness should be improved
3. **Implement Suggestions**: Apply the judge's specific recommendations
4. **Maintain Authenticity**: Keep it human and conversational
5. **No Overpromising**: Stay realistic about feature capabilities
6. **Simple Language**: Avoid jargon—write for non-technical readers
7. **Customer Voice**: Include authentic customer quotes
8. **Quantify Benefits**: Use specific numbers for impact
