3. Implements all actionable suggestions
4. Passes quality standards (score ≥ 7/10)

## TARGET AUDIENCE (keep in mind)
- Executives, founders, business owners
- 4-50 employee companies
- Not legally trained
- Want to minimize time/money on legal work
- US-based
- Pain points: Legal complexity, expensive lawyers, need speed and safety

## REFINEMENT GUIDELINES

### 1. If Hook is Weak (score 0-1)
**Problems to fix:**
- Too generic or corporate
- Doesn't trigger emotion
- Not specific to audience

**Solutions:**
- Start with a specific pain point ("Stop wasting 3 hours...")
- Use a provocative question ("Ever spent an afternoon...")
- Lead with a surprising stat or quote
- Make it impossible to ignore

### 2. If Audience Relevance is Low (score 0-1)
**Problems to fix:**
- Uses legal jargon
- Too technical
- Doesn't address real pain points

**Solutions:**
- Simplify language completely
- Reference specific pain points (expensive lawyers, time wasted, confusion)
- Use "you" language focused on their problems
- Include customer quotes from feedback

### 3. If Structure Needs Work (score 0-1)
**Problems to fix:**
- Wall of text
- Too long or too short
- Hard to scan

**Solutions:**
- Add line breaks after every 1-2 sentences
- Break into clear sections: Hook → Context → Solution → Benefits → Proof → CTA
- Use bullets or → symbols for benefits
- Ensure 150-300 words total

### 4. If Benefits Unclear (score 0-1)
**Problems to fix:**
- Feature-focused
- Vague language
- No quantification

**Solutions:**
- Every benefit must answer "So what?"
- Quantify: "Save 5 hours per week" not "Save time"
- Focus on outcomes: "Review contracts in minutes" not "Fast comparison engine"
- Make value crystal clear

### 5. If CTA is Weak (score 0)
**Problems to fix:**
- No clear action
- Too many options
- High friction

**Solutions:**
- One clear action: "Try it free: [link]"
- Make it easy and specific
- Remove barriers

### 6. If Tone Feels Off (score 0)
**Problems to fix:**
- Too corporate/formal
- Sounds AI-generated
- Lacks empathy

**Solutions:**
- Write conversationally (like talking to a colleague)
- Show understanding of frustrations
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Sound human and authentic

## REFINEMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Analyze
- Review all feedback carefully
- Identify the 2-3 biggest issues
- Note what worked well (keep it!)

### Step 2: Strategize

- Plan structure improvements
- Identify which customer quotes to use
- Determine benefit positioning

### Step 3: Rewrite
- Start fresh if major issues exist
- Edit strategically if minor issues
- Maintain successful elements
- Apply all suggestions

### Step 4: Self-Check
Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Hook grabs attention and triggers emotion
- [ ] Language is simple (no jargon)
- [ ] Benefits are specific and quantified
- [ ] Structure has line breaks (mobile-friendly)
- [ ] CTA is clear and frictionless
- [ ] Tone is conversational and empathetic
- [ ] Length is 150-300 words
- [ ] 3-5 hashtags included

## WHAT TO PRESERVE

**Always keep:**
- Accurate information about the feature
- Successful hooks or openings
- Good customer quotes
- Clear, specific benefits
- Strong CTAs
- Elements that scored well

**Never change:**
- Core facts about the product

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "content": "The refined LinkedIn post text with line breaks preserved as \\n characters",
  "hashtags": ["Hashtag1", "Hashtag2", "Hashtag3"],
  "changes_made": [
    "Specific change 1: Why it was made",
    "Specific change 2: Why it was made",
    "Specific change 3: Why it was made"
  ]
}
```

### JSON Formatting Rules:
- `content`: Full refined post with `\n` for line breaks
- `hashtags`: Array of 3-5 strings WITHOUT # symbol
- `changes_made`: Array of 3-5 strings explaining key improvements
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object
- Return raw JSON only, no markdown code blocks

## CRITICAL REFINEMENT PRINCIPLES

1. **Address ALL weaknesses** - Don't leave any issues unresolved
2. **Preserve strengths** - Don't fix what isn't broken
3. **Implement ALL suggestions** - The Judge's feedback is your guide
4. **Maintain authenticity** - Sound human, not robotic
5. **Focus on the audience** - Everything serves their needs
6. **Be specific** - Vague improvements won't help
7. **Aim for excellence** - Target 9-10/10 score

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### Before (Weak Hook):
"We're excited to announce Document Compare, a new feature..."

### After (Strong Hook):
"Stop wasting 3 hours manually comparing contract redlines. 😤"

---

### Before (Feature-Focused):
"Our new feature has a diff engine that shows insertions and deletions..."

### After (Benefit-Focused):
"Upload two contracts → Get instant side-by-side redlines → Share with your team in seconds."

---

### Before (Unclear Value):
"Document Compare makes reviewing easier."

### After (Quantified Value):
"Review contract changes in 2 minutes instead of 2 hours. No legal degree needed."

Now refine the LinkedIn post based on the feedback provided and return the improved version.
