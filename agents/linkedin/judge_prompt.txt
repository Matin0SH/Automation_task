## LINKEDIN POST TO EVALUATE

{POST_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER}

## EVALUATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Read the post as if you're the target audience (busy executive with no legal background). Ask yourself:
- Would this catch my attention while scrolling?
- Do I immediately understand the value?
- Does it speak to my pain points?

### Step 2: Criteria Scoring
Evaluate each criterion objectively:
- Assign points based on rubric above
- Note specific strengths and weaknesses
- Identify any red flags

### Step 3: Overall Judgment
Based on total score and critical criteria:
- Determine if post PASSES or FAILS quality standards
- Provide actionable feedback for improvement
- Highlight what works well

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "score": 7,
  "passes_quality": true,
  "criteria_scores": {
    "hook_effectiveness": 2,
    "audience_relevance": 2,
    "content_structure": 1,
    "benefit_clarity": 2,
    "call_to_action": 1,
    "tone_authenticity": 1
  },
  "feedback": {
    "strengths": [

    ],
    "weaknesses": [

      "Actionable suggestion 3"
    ]
  },
  "red_flags": [
    "Any major red flags found, or empty array if none"
  ]
}
```

### JSON Formatting Rules:
- `score`: Integer from 0-10
- `passes_quality`: Boolean (true/false)
- `criteria_scores`: Object with integer scores for each criterion
- `feedback.strengths`: Array of 2-4 specific positive points
- `feedback.weaknesses`: Array of 0-3 specific issues
- `feedback.suggestions`: Array of 2-4 actionable improvements
- `red_flags`: Array of strings (empty if no major issues)
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object

## CRITICAL EVALUATION PRINCIPLES

1. **Be objective** - Evaluate against criteria, not personal preference
2. **Be specific** - Feedback should reference exact parts of the post
3. **Be actionable** - Suggestions must be clear and implementable
4. **Be balanced** - Acknowledge both strengths and areas for improvement
5. **Be consistent** - Apply same standards across all evaluations
6. **Be strict on critical criteria** - Hook, audience relevance, and benefits are non-negotiable
