# LINKEDIN POST GENERATOR PROMPT

## TASK
Generate a compelling LinkedIn post to announce and create excitement for the new feature.

## LINKEDIN-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Format Specifications
- **Length**: 150-300 words (short and punchy)
- **Mobile-friendly**: Use line breaks after every 1-2 sentences
- **Structure**: Hook → Context → Solution → Benefits → Proof → CTA
- **Hashtags**: Include exactly 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end

### Content Structure

#### 1. HOOK (1-2 lines)
- Start with a pain point, surprising stat, or provocative question
- Must stop the scroll - make it impossible to ignore
- Trigger an emotion: frustration, recognition, curiosity
- Examples:
  - "Stop wasting 3 hours manually comparing contract redlines."
  - "Ever spent an entire afternoon hunting for what changed in a contract?"
  - "Your lawyer charges $400/hour to compare two documents. There's a better way."

#### 2. CONTEXT (2-3 lines)
- Relate to the reader's experience
- Build empathy and understanding
- Use a customer quote from the feedback if relevant
- Show you understand their world

#### 3. SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (1-2 lines)
- Present the feature simply and clearly
- Focus on the benefit, not the technology
- Make it feel accessible and easy

#### 4. KEY BENEFITS (3-5 bullet points or short lines)
- Each benefit on its own line with line breaks
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Use specific, quantifiable language when possible
- Format options:
  - "→ Benefit one"
  - "✓ Benefit two" (if emojis fit the tone)
  - Simple bullets

#### 5. SOCIAL PROOF OR EXAMPLE (1-2 lines)
- Customer quote from feedback documents
- Internal team reaction
- Use case scenario
- Builds credibility and relatability

#### 6. CALL TO ACTION (1-2 lines)
- Clear, single action to take
- Make it easy and friction-free
- Examples:
  - "Try it free: [link]"
  - "See it in action: [link]"
  - "Start comparing contracts today: [link]"

#### 7. HASHTAGS (3-5)
- Mix of broad and specific
- Relevant to legal tech, startups, small business
- Examples: #LegalTech #Startups #SmallBusiness #Contracts #Founders

### Tone & Style
- Professional but conversational
- Confident without being arrogant
- Helpful and empathetic
- Authentic - sound human, not corporate
- Energetic and engaging

### Advanced Techniques to Apply

#### Multi-Persona Approach
Think as three experts collaborating:
1. **Marketing Strategist** - Knows how to position B2B SaaS value
2. **LinkedIn Copywriter** - Understands what performs on the platform
3. **Small Business Owner** - Experienced the pain points firsthand

#### Chain-of-Thought Analysis
Before writing, consider:
1. What is the #1 pain point for this audience?
2. What emotion should the hook trigger?
3. What's the most compelling benefit to highlight?
4. Which customer quote is most relatable?
5. What action is easiest for readers to take?

#### Self-Reflection
After drafting, review:
- Is the hook compelling enough to stop scrolling?
- Does it address real audience pain points?
- Are benefits clear and specific?
- Is the CTA obvious and actionable?
- Are sentences short and scannable?

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "content": "The full LinkedIn post text with line breaks preserved as \\n characters",
  "hashtags": ["Hashtag1", "Hashtag2", "Hashtag3"]
}
```

### CRITICAL JSON Formatting Rules - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY - VIOLATIONS WILL CAUSE SYSTEM FAILURE:**

1. **ESCAPE ALL DOUBLE QUOTES IN STRING VALUES**
   - When including customer quotes, you MUST escape internal quotes
   - WRONG: "content": "Users say "this is great" for business"
   - CORRECT: "content": "Users say \"this is great\" for business"
   - BETTER: "content": "Users say 'this is great' for business"

2. **USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR CUSTOMER QUOTES**
   - Prefer single quotes to avoid escaping: 'quote here'
   - This prevents JSON parsing errors

3. **VALIDATE YOUR OUTPUT**
   - Your JSON must be parseable by standard parsers
   - Every opening quote needs proper closing
   - Check for unescaped quotes before responding

4. **STANDARD REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Escape line breaks as `\n` in the content string
   - Hashtags array should contain 3-5 strings WITHOUT the # symbol
   - The entire response must be valid JSON
   - Do not include any text outside the JSON object
   - Do not use markdown code blocks - return raw JSON only

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. Use simple language - the audience is NOT legally trained
2. Focus on TIME SAVED and EASE OF USE
3. Don't make it sound like legal advice or a lawyer replacement
4. Pull authentic quotes from Customer Feedback documents - USE SINGLE QUOTES for all customer quotes
5. Quantify benefits when possible (hours saved, clicks reduced, etc.)
6. Keep it conversational and relatable
7. Make the CTA frictionless and clear

Now generate the LinkedIn post based on the topic and source documents provided.
