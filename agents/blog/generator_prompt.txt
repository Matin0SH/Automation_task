## EXAMPLES OF GOOD BLOG POSTS

The following examples demonstrate the style, tone, and structure we're aiming for:

{EXAMPLES_PLACEHOLDER}

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You must return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Compelling blog post title (50-80 characters, SEO-friendly)",
  "content": "The full blog post content with line breaks preserved as \\n characters"
}
```

### CRITICAL JSON Formatting Rules - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY - VIOLATIONS WILL CAUSE SYSTEM FAILURE:**

1. **ESCAPE ALL DOUBLE QUOTES IN STRING VALUES**
   - When including customer quotes, you MUST escape internal quotes
   - WRONG: "content": "Users say "this is great" for business"
   - CORRECT: "content": "Users say \"this is great\" for business"
   - BETTER: "content": "Users say 'this is great' for business"

2. **USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR CUSTOMER QUOTES**
   - Prefer single quotes to avoid escaping: 'quote here'
   - This prevents JSON parsing errors

3. **VALIDATE YOUR OUTPUT**
   - Your JSON must be parseable by standard parsers
   - Every opening quote needs proper closing
   - Check for unescaped quotes before responding

4. **STANDARD REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Escape line breaks as `\n` in the content string
   - title should be SEO-friendly and compelling (50-80 characters)
   - The entire response must be valid JSON
   - Do not include any text outside the JSON object
   - Do not use markdown code blocks - return raw JSON only
   - Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks
   - Use section headers (## Header) for structure

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Simple Language**: The audience is NOT legally trained—avoid legalese and jargon
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: TIME SAVED and EASE OF USE are the primary selling points
3. **Not Legal Advice**: Don't make it sound like legal advice or a lawyer replacement
4. **Authentic Quotes**: Pull real, relatable quotes from Customer Feedback documents - USE SINGLE QUOTES for all customer quotes
5. **Quantify Benefits**: Use specific numbers (hours saved, clicks reduced, etc.)
6. **Educational Tone**: Teach readers about the problem and solution
7. **SEO-Conscious**: Include feature name and relevant keywords naturally
8. **Scannable Structure**: Use headers, bullets, short paragraphs
