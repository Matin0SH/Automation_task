  "body": "Hi there,\n\nWe've all been there: staring at a 40-page contract at 11 PM, trying to catch every risky clause before you sign.\n\nIt's exhausting. And honestly? It's a terrible use of your time as a founder.\n\nThat's why we built Genie AI's Contract Review feature.\n\nIt uses AI to instantly flag risky clauses, suggest improvements, and explain complex legal language in plain English—so you can review contracts in minutes, not hours.\n\nHere's what it does:\n\n✓ Instantly identifies risky clauses (termination, liability, IP rights)\n✓ Explains legal jargon in simple terms you can actually understand\n✓ Suggests alternative language to protect your interests\n✓ Works on any contract type—NDAs, vendor agreements, partnerships\n✓ Saves you from $500/hour legal fees on routine reviews\n\nAs one beta tester put it: \"I used to spend 3 hours reviewing vendor contracts. Now it takes 20 minutes.\"\n\nImagine getting back those hours every single week.\n\nReady to stop drowning in legal paperwork?\n\nTry Contract Review free today: app.genieai.co/review\n\nBest,\nSarah Chen\nHead of Product, Genie AI\n\nP.S. This doesn't replace your lawyer for complex deals—but it sure makes the routine stuff a lot easier."
