  "body": "Hey,\n\nQuestion: How many times have you copied clauses from old contracts, hoping they're still legally sound?\n\nIf you're like most founders we talked to, the answer is \"way too many.\"\n\nThe problem? You're never quite sure if that 3-year-old NDA clause is still best practice. Or if you're accidentally creating liability issues.\n\nThat's why we're launching the Smart Clause Library.\n\nIt's a growing collection of vetted, plain-English contract clauses you can drop into any document—confidently.\n\nHere's what makes it different:\n\n→ 200+ pre-written clauses for common business needs (NDAs, employment, vendor agreements)\n→ Plain English explanations so you actually understand what you're signing\n→ Regular updates when laws change or best practices evolve\n→ One-click insertion into any Genie AI document\n→ Customizable to your specific business needs\n\nOne early adopter told us: \"I used to Google 'non-compete clause example' and pray I picked the right one. This is so much better.\"\n\nStop reinventing the wheel every time you need a contract.\n\nExplore the Smart Clause Library: app.genieai.co/library\n\nCheers,\nMike Rodriguez\nCo-Founder, Genie AI"
