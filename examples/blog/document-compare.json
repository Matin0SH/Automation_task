But wait – they sent a \"revised version\" this morning.\n\nNow you're stuck scrolling between two Word documents, trying to spot what changed. Did they adjust the payment terms? Remove a liability clause? Add new obligations?\n\nThree hours later, you're still not 100% sure you caught everything.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n## Why Manual Contract Comparison Wastes Your Time\n\nThe average small business executive spends 5-7 hours per week reviewing legal documents. And for contracts with multiple revisions? That number doubles.\n\nHere's what that looks like:\n\n- Opening two documents side-by-side\n- Scrolling endlessly trying to keep your place\n- Missing subtle wording changes\n- Worrying you overlooked something critical\n- Paying lawyers $400/hour to do it for you\n\nThere has to be a better way.\n\n## Introducing Document Compare\n\nDocument Compare is like having a legal assistant who never sleeps, never misses a detail, and works in seconds.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n### Step 1: Upload Two Documents\nDrag and drop any two versions – DOCX, PDF, or Genie docs. No conversion needed.\n\n### Step 2: Get Instant Redlines\nOur diff engine analyzes both documents and highlights:\n- ✓ Text that was added (in green)\n- ✓ Text that was removed (in red)  \n- ✓ Text that was modified (in yellow)\n\n### Step 3: Review Changes in Minutes\nSee exactly what changed in a clean, side-by-side view or unified diff format.\n\n### Step 4: Share with Your Team\nExport the comparison to share with co-founders, investors, or your lawyer.\n\n## Real Results from Real Users\n\n*\"I hate manually scrolling between two Word docs.\"* – Before using Document Compare\n\n*\"This would save me from begging our counsel to check every clause.\"* – Founder, 15-person SaaS company\n\n*\"Feels like magic when it shows the redlines correctly.\"* – Internal beta tester\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n**Save Hours Per Review**\nWhat used to take 2-3 hours now takes 2-3 minutes.\n\n**Catch Hidden Risks**\nNever miss a subtle change buried in page 8, paragraph 4.\n\n**Work Across Formats**\nCompare Genie docs, Word files, and PDFs seamlessly.\n\n**No Legal Degree Needed**\nClear, visual highlighting makes changes obvious.\n\n**Share Confidently**\nExport clean redlines to share with stakeholders.\n\n## How Document Compare Differs from Track Changes\n\nMicrosoft Word's \"Track Changes\" only works if:\n1. The other party used Track Changes\n2. They didn't accept/reject changes before sending\n3. You're comparing Word docs (not PDFs)\n\nDocument Compare works regardless of how the other party edited. It's a true comparison engine, not dependent on change tracking.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nReady to stop wasting hours on contract reviews?\n\n1. Sign up for Genie AI (free account available)\n2.
