## Channel-Specific Requirements

### LinkedIn Post

**Format:**
- **Length**: 150-300 words (short & punchy)
- **Hook**: First line must grab attention immediately
- **Tone**: Professional but conversational
- **Structure**: Short lines with line breaks for mobile readability
- **Call-to-action**: Clear CTA at the end
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant hashtags
- **Paragraphs**: No long blocks of text - people scroll fast

**Best Practices:**
- Start with a pain point or question
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 max) for visual breaks
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Make it shareable - content colleagues would forward
- Include a direct link or CTA

**Example Structure:**
```
[Pain point/Hook - 1 line]

[Relatable scenario - 2-3 lines]

[Solution introduction - 1-2 lines]

[How it works - 3 bullet points or short lines]

### Newsletter Email

**Format:**
- **Subject Line**: Compelling, benefit-driven (required)
- **Greeting**: Personal ("Hi there," or "Hey [Name],")
- **Length**: 300-500 words
- **Structure**: Storytelling format (problem → solution → action)
- **Formatting**: Short paragraphs, bullet points for scannability
- **CTA**: Clear button/link with action text
- **Tone**: Conversational, like talking to a friend

**Best Practices:**
- Subject line should create curiosity or promise value
- Open with a relatable problem/story
- Use "you" language throughout

- End with a friendly sign-off

**Example Structure:**
```

Here's how it works:
• [Benefit 1]

## Engagement & Excitement Tactics

### 1. Create Emotional Connection
- Start with frustration/pain points they recognize
- Use customer quotes and real scenarios
- Show empathy: "We've all been there..."

### 2. Quantify Benefits
- "Save 5 hours per contract review"
- "Reduce legal spend by 50%"
- "Review contracts in minutes, not hours"

### 3. Use Social Proof
- "Founders are already saying..."
- "Companies using this report..."
- Real customer quotes from feedback documents

### 4. Create Urgency/FOMO
- "Join companies already using this"
- "Available now for Pro Plan users"
- "Start saving time today"

### 5. Make It Actionable
- Clear, single call-to-action
- Remove friction: "Try it free"
- Direct links to product

### 6. Power Words for Engagement
- **Speed**: instant, immediately, in seconds, fast
- **Ease**: effortless, simple, easy, automatic
- **Impact**: game-changer, revolutionary, finally
- **Trust**: reliable, accurate, deterministic, professional
- **Value**: save, free, reduce, eliminate

## Example: Good vs. Bad Content

### ❌ BAD (Generic, Not Engaging)
> "Genie AI has released Document Compare. It compares documents and shows differences. This feature is now available to all users."

**Why it fails:**
- No emotion or hook
- Doesn't address pain points
- Technical/dry language
- No clear benefit
- Weak CTA

### ✅ GOOD (Platform-Appropriate, Engaging)
> "Stop wasting 3 hours manually comparing contract redlines. 😤
>
> Last week, a founder told me: 'I just want to see what changed, not read everything again.'
>
> That's exactly why we built Document Compare.
>
> Upload two contracts → Get instant side-by-side redlines → Share with your team in seconds.
>
> No legal degree needed. No expensive lawyers. Just clarity.
>
> Try it free: [link]
>
> #LegalTech #Startups #Contracts"

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Emotional hook (pain point)
- ✅ Relatable customer quote
- ✅ Clear, simple benefit
- ✅ Easy-to-scan format
- ✅ Strong, direct CTA
- ✅ Platform-appropriate (LinkedIn)
