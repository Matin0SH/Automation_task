**Purpose**: Professional prompt engineering for blog channel

## Key Findings Summary

B2B SaaS blog posts in 2025 prioritize quality over quantity, with emphasis on Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), E-E-A-T compliance, and comprehensive content that serves as authoritative resources. The shift toward AI-driven search requires structured, question-answering content that demonstrates expertise.

---

## Content Structure Best Practices

### Pillar-Based Content Model (PBCM)

> "A pillar-based content model (PBCM) typically includes one main pillar of at least 3,000 words that thoroughly summarizes a large topic, a few sub-pillars of around 2,000 words exploring specific aspects, and supporting blogs dedicated to answering specific questions about the pillar/sub-pillar themes."

For product announcements, this translates to:
- **Main pillar**: Comprehensive feature announcement (800-1200 words)
- **Supporting content**: How-to guides, use cases, comparisons (400-800 words)

### Topic Clusters Approach
> "Content should be organized into topic clusters, starting with comprehensive pillar pages that address broad industry challenges, supported by interconnected articles that answer specific questions throughout the buyer's journey, enhancing user experience and establishing your site as an authoritative resource."

**Benefits**:
- Improved SEO performance
- Better user experience
- Establishes topical authority
- Supports different buyer journey stages

- Structure content to answer specific questions:
  - What is this feature?
  - How does it work?
  - Who is it for?
  - What problems does it solve?
  - How do I get started?

### Content Formatting
- **Headers**: Clear H2/H3 structure
- **Short paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences maximum

## Funnel-Based Content Approach

### Top of Funnel (TOFU)

For product announcements at TOFU:
- Focus on the problem being solved
- Educational approach
- Industry challenges and trends
- Broad appeal to attract awareness

### Content Journey Stages
> "Your content must be targeted at users at the different stages of the customer journey, with all customers passing through three main stages of the funnel that should inform how you craft B2B SaaS content."

**Three Stages**:
1. **Awareness**: Problem-focused, educational
2. **Consideration**: Solution comparison, benefits
3. **Decision**: Product specifics, pricing, getting started

## Writing Best Practices

### User-Centric Focus
> "Make announcements about users, not you—focus on what a new feature is and how it will improve a user's life."

**Instead of**: "We built an amazing new AI-powered algorithm..."
**Write**: "You can now review contracts 10x faster with instant AI analysis..."

### Avoid Technical Jargon
> "Avoid technical jargon; keep language simple and focus on how the update helps users, not how it works behind the scenes."

**Technical**: "Leverages NLP and machine learning algorithms to parse document structure..."
**Simple**: "Instantly understands your document and highlights what matters most..."

### Tone Guidelines
- **Professional**: Establish credibility
- **Conversational**: Accessible, not academic
- **Educational**: Teach, don't just sell
- **Empathetic**: Show understanding of challenges
- **Confident**: Assert value without arrogance
