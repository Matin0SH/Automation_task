        "The hook is highly effective, immediately addressing a key pain point with empathy and a relatable emoji.",

        "The phrase \"That's why we're thrilled to introduce...\" is slightly more corporate than the otherwise very conversational and empathetic tone of the post."
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Consider refining the introduction of the new feature to maintain a consistent conversational tone, perhaps using phrasing like \"That's why we built Genie AI's new Document Compare feature!\" or \"So, we're making it easier with Genie AI's Document Compare.\"",
        "While the current hashtags are relevant, explore adding one or two more outcome-focused hashtags such as #ContractReview or #LegalSimplified to potentially increase discoverability for users searching for solutions."
