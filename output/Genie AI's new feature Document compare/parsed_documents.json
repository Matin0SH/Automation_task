    "engineering_ticket": "Feature: Document Compare\n Author: Dan\n Version: 0.9 (beta)\nOverview\nNative diff engine built into Genie’s real-time editor. Designed to:\nCompare two Genie docs (same schema) OR a Genie doc vs external file.\nProduce two outputs:\nSide-by-side diff – shows insertions/deletions line-by-line.\nUnified diff view – single merged doc with redlines.\nImplementation\nUses operational transform (OT) layer diffing.\nHandles moved-paragraph detection (with fallback).\nOutputs deterministic hashes for auditability (Diff ID).\nAI integration (optional): summarise key changes, flag risky clauses, suggest rewrite.\nKnown Issues\nPDF extraction unreliable → fallback to “content only” comparison.\nParallel edits cause false conflicts (to be improved with per-block locks).\nPerformance degrades slightly >100 pages; mitigated with virtualised rendering.\nDependencies\ngenie-engine (internal module)\npdf-parser\nopenai-client (for explain-the-diff)",
    "meeting_transcript": "Meeting Transcript (Product + Engineering + Marketing)\nWill (Marketing): Okay, so we’re prepping launch content for “Document Compare” - that’s the final decision on the customer-facing name for it. Can we confirm, what’s the actual user win here?\nSophie (Growth Engineer): Founders and execs spend hours reading redlines. Compare lets them instantly see what’s new or removed - literally a time-saver feature.\nNitish (CTO): It’s all built into our editor, not a third-party plugin. You can compare any two Genie docs, or even upload a DOCX to compare with one in the system.\nWill: So this is a native Genie feature, not some external viewer?\nNitish: Exactly. Full diff engine. We show both side-by-side and merged diff view. The merged diff is exportable - great for sharing with investors or counterparties.\nEd (Sales): That’s gold. We’ve had so many enterprise leads asking for “redline exports.”\nWill: Okay, so in content we highlight: “Instant redlines, effortless review.”\nNitish: Yep. But avoid making it sound like a legal opinion generator - we’re not summarising contracts yet, that’s another feature.\nSophie: We actually are planning to add an “AI explain the diff” sidebar later though.\nWill: Should we mention that in the blog?\nNitish: Maybe as “coming soon”.\n[crosstalk about lunch catering and a Slack bug - irrelevant]\nWill: Sorry, ignore that part - we don’t need to mention the Mixpanel tracking schema in the marketing piece.\nSophie: Wait, the metric we’re tracking post-launch is % of Pro Plan companies doing 2+ compares per week, right?\nNitish: Correct.",
    "marketing_notes": "Marketing & Product Meeting Notes\n● “Compare” lets you see what changed between two versions of a legal doc - like track\nchanges but clearer.\n● We’re calling it Document Compare or Compare View externally.\n● Core goal → speed up review for founders & execs drowning in contract versions.\n● Existing users already ask: “Can I see what changed between this NDA and last week’s\none?”\n● Should work across formats (DOCX, Genie docs, PDFs).\n● Launch goal = increase document review frequency per user.\n● Early internal feedback: “Feels like magic when it shows the redlines correctly.”\n● Don't overexplain legal detail - focus on time saved, accuracy, peace of mind.\n● Could tie into “AI Review” product but shouldn’t cannibalise it.\n● This is part of a bigger Versioning & Collaboration roadmap.\n● 📈 25% of Pro Plan companies should use Compare 2+ times per week within 4 weeks.\n● Important: The diff needs to be deterministic for legal trust → “same input always = same\noutput.”\n● Might later include an “AI Summary of Changes” sidebar - explain in plain English what\nchanged and what it means.",
    "customer_feedback": "🗣️ Customer feedback snippets (rough/unstructured)\n“I hate manually scrolling between two Word docs.”\n“Redlines are a nightmare when you’re not a lawyer.”\n“This would save me from begging our counsel to check every clause.”\n“I just want to see what changed, not read everything again.”\n“Sometimes I just need to share the changes with my cofounder quickly.”"
